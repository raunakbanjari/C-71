So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep and happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible. </p>

                <p>With The Lion King being my favorite animated Disney movie, I’ve watched it many times as a kid, as an adult and shared it with my kids.

                    I’m not sure what people mean when they say it lacks heart? Yes it’s the same story, same scenes etc. but it’s a remade version, which you can tell Disney was very careful with. When Alice in Wonderland came out, I was hoping and excited for The Lion King. More live action movies released and I know it was only a matter of time.

                    This movie is fantastic. Not since Avatar have I been blown away by the visuals. Disney did such a good job on the animations, the animals move realistically, they look realistic and if animals could talk, this is how they would look while talking. A lot of people are hating on this movie to be part of the crowd, I give this 5 stars because the story wasn’t changed, the CG is seriously mind blowing, the soundtrack was done in justice, it’s darker than the animated original and it was pretty action filled.

                    I feel this movie benefits from its live action. Scar looks more menacing, and you do get emotional and a heart warming sensation when watching because you see how an animal would actually look like when happy or sad. Maybe the negative reviews were from people who don’t have any pets?

                    This is a must watch, and sits next to some of the best movies I’ve ever seen.

                <p>HOLY! WOW! WHAT AN ADVENTURE! I loved how the story focused on bringing others together then blowing things up. I loved how the story was set in Autumn. Autumn is the season that most people aren’t interested in. When people watch this movie people will realize that Autumn is festive if we just see it from a different perspective. I also loved how the native people who lived in the forest rely upon and trust nature. That is the way we are supposed to view nature. This movie is connecting to the four great natural resources that we use on our planet - Air, Fire, Water, and Earth. That is so environmentalist! Without these resources, we wouldn't exist! My favorite characters are Elsa and Anna. I really loved Elsa and Anna's character because these girls are worthy of taking risks on their own just like men do. Also, their mother had these two daughters for a very important reason. Elsa performed by Idina Menzel is the perfect mythic and larger than life character. Grateful her kingdom now accepts her, she works hard to be a good queen. But deep down she can’t help but wonder why she was born with powers. When Elsa hears a voice that only she can hear it made me think it’s something important. Like maybe something she has forgotten or maybe something she's supposed to know. At the end of the movie, she realizes who she really is. That's why the creators made her hair white. Elsa was born with white hair and she couldn't change it. She finds out what her hair means. Something even more than having her power. As for Anna, I really loved her character too. Anna performed by Kristen Bell is the perfect fairytale character - unflappable, she is the forever optimist. Anna is fine as long as she has her family, Arendelle is safe, and she never has to be alone again. As Anna journeys with Elsa to the enchanted forests beyond Arendelle, along with Kristoff, Olaf and Sven, she wonders if they can ever return to the happiness they once knew. I also enjoyed Kristoff's performance by Jonathan Groff. Kristoff doesn’t hesitate to be there for Anna and Elsa as they journey into mysterious lands that even this well-traveled iceman has never seen. I also was very amused by Olaf's performance by Josh Gad. Having learned to read, he’s absolutely fascinated with the various wonders of life. With his new curiosity for knowledge, Olaf is a source of hope in dark times. Olaf also states a very deep sentiment in this movie and that is, "Water has memory." That has a so deep meaning! Olaf also learns in this movie that there are some conflicts in life. And I also really enjoyed Sven's character. Although Kristoff now has the love of his life with Anna, he still finds himself leaning on Sven as a best friend and a confidante and mentor, especially as Kristoff’s attempts to propose to Anna go awry. Sven tries his best to help out his best friend and makes sure that he guides down the right path. Also what I really loved about this movie is that all of the cast members who were in this movie sounded like angels! When looking at the music score, my favorite song was, “Show Yourself." The message is that if you follow your dreams, you will see who you are and you will become who you were born to be. This movie is filled with generosity, integrity, optimism, cooperation, tolerance, and above all, spirituality. Thank you so much Walt Disney Animated Studios for the astounding movie! Please keep making more films that focus on heartfelt messages which bring people together by accepting differences and hearing stories that go unnoticed.
